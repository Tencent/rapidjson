# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
* Refactored Writer and PrettyWriter to both directly inherit from new class WriterBase and moved all common code into WriterBase. Much less code.
* WriterBase extends Writer and PrettyWriter by adding overloaded functor methods that write values, ie: bool operator()(TYPE value) where TYPE is one of the types you can write to JSON.
* WriterBase extends Writer and PrettyWriter by adding overloaded functor methods that write key/value pair. ie bool operator()(char *key, TYPE value) where TYPE is one of the types you can write to JSON.
* WriterBase has overloaded all functions that take a string as a parameter in such a way that it can differentiate between string literals and char * variables. It avoids a redundant strlen call for string literals as the length is known at compile time.
* Added new classes ObjectBlock and ArrayBlock. On construction they will start and Object/Array and on destruction close and Object/Array automatically. Reduces bugs and complexity of code by removing the need to remember to close and open Object/Array.
