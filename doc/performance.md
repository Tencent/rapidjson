# Performance

The old performance article for RapidJSON 0.1 is provided [here](https://code.google.com/p/rapidjson/wiki/Performance).

The (third-party) performance tests have been removed from this repository
and are now part of a dedicated [native JSON benchmark collection] [1].

This file will be updated with a summary of benchmarking results based on
the above benchmark collection in the future.
